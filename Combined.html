<h2>Long time age in galaxy far far away</h2>
<hr>
<h4>STAR WARS GALACTIC MARINES GENESIS </h4>

Sergeant Lead stood straight and tall within the centre
of the carnage, with deceased bodies of flesh and metal
littered all over the gore, orange landscape. Towering at
a height of two meters, his philtrum flecked with dried-
caked blood dripping from his nostrils, and a dark patched
eye on his exposed face, had divulged the war-scars he
had gotten during the last and final ambush.
     Geonosis was finally occupied by the Republic. The
opening battle of this conflict—this crucible—has resulted
in a Republic victory. Victory with a heavy cost. Little did
the clones realized this war would be the very thing that
would one day result in the inevitable annihilation of an
entire order, which the clones would now swore to


protect as their Generals.
     “Ah, so you must be Captain Lead,”
     Lead stiffened his arms and legs when he saw an elder
Cerean approaching him from the left. A common
man might mistake him as a refugee from poor worlds
like Tatooine, but thanks to the proper education Lead
and his fellow expendable brothers gained while their
earlier years as younglings in their home planet of
Kamino, Lead knew that he was a Jedi.
     Clad in light brown robes with a metallic hilt hanging
from his belt buckle, the old Cerean Jedi walked with a
casual conduct—no not casual, calm conduct, maintaining
an aura of confidence, yet charisma. His facial frame
looked crooked like the crime Lords of Nal Hutta and Nar
Shadda, but it also released a scent of serenity—a
fragment of peacefulness and hope in a grim, shattered
atmosphere in an aftermath of chaos.
     “Sergeant, General,” Lead corrected after shaking
hands with the Jedi, “Thanks for the air support, sir.”
     The Cerean only gave a slight smile and a slow nod
as an understatement rather than an agreement, then
informed, “I am General Ki-Adi-Mundi of the Jedi High
Council, and l would be leading the 21st Battalion as its
first-in-command. You may also acknowledge me as sir.”
     “It’s an honour to be serving under you, Sir.” Lead
was trying to maintain his sturdy and stern frame
despite the unnerving pain that was borne from the black


lump patched below his left eyelid.
    Being a part of the High Council was the greatest
achievement a Jedi Master can acquire. Headquartered at
the Republic’s capital planet Courascant, the Jedi High
Council was the governing body of the Ancient Jedi
Order—a noble religious order that has been
maintaining peace and order in the galaxy for a
millennium since the final battle of Russan. For the last
thousand years, the Jedi have had themselves isolated
from the rest of the galaxy, hidden in their cradle of
power. And thus had been a well-known yet a mysterious
organization to the galaxy. So much so, that some
believed that they were frankly nothing more than a
political agenda of the Republic. Some rumoured the Jedi
to be an evil funded cult stealing babies for rituals. But
these were just rumours, after all. But now that the
thousand years’ chain of the Great Peace has broken, the
Jedi have been handed the responsibility to lead the
grand army with the help of the newly re-formed Republic
Navy. Lead was frankly surprised at how calm and
confident the Cerean looked, even after such bloodshed.
“And it's a Legion, to be precise,” added Lead, “A
battalion is nothing more than just a small division of it.”
    Ki-Adi-Mundi gave a slow paced, impressed nod as an
agreement, then informed, while turning slightly left, “I
heard from your colleagues that you shown quite a
leadership during the ambush. I must say l was quite
impressed after hearing the artful valour and leadership


you have shown.”
     Lead started getting flashbacks, but tried shrugging
them off, “Thank you sir.” He paused, then complained,
“Sir, l think the admiration feels a bit exaggerating. I
mean, ugh.. the casualties—”
     “That is not your fault, Sarge.” The Cerean General
intervened, “You were overwhelmed by the rivals.”
     The General paused, then added, “Actually, l was
thinking of promoting you to the rank of a Captain.”
     Lead tried hiding his contentment as his eyebrows
twinkled in astonishment, but returned to the same
sturdy face almost immediately. Part of him felt like he
wasn’t worth it yet. “Sir, l feel like l don’t deserve it but.”
     “You certainly do, Captain. If it wasn’t for your
leadership, l doubt that Bacara could have even made it
out alive.”
     A slight desperation and inquisitiveness sparkled on
Lead’s face, “Sir, is the Commander alright?”
    “Fine in all likelihood.” The Cerean replied, turning
away from Lead. “He is transported back to Kamino.”
     And instead of pressing any further, Lead gladly
accepted the offer, although not certain if Bacara would
allow it.
     Ki-Adi-Mundi waited for a moment before replying and
turning away, “So, l suppose we are done here, then.”


CT–03–1999 trudged hopelessly over the carnage left by the


skirmish. The surface was tinted red and the sky was a vague of
blood, with drops of ichor dripping as reddish rain on his
shaved head. The land was predominated by bodies of his
fellow brothers, and scraps of his foes and machineries, rusting
gunships and Capital ships.
     The poor soldier sat beside a fallen Republic Gunship,
leaning on its crunchy, decaying, metallic wall. A sudden strong
whirl of wind send shivers down his spine. He looked up and
scanned the horizon; only darkness in the horizon, and the tall,
destroyed hives of the native Geonosians who allied with the
Separatists. The total blackness of the horizon was uniformly
separated with the reddish, gore skies—as if it were a reverse
twilight. He noticed something else in the horizon as well : the
silhouettes of the Kaminoans, the very creators of the Clone
Army; long, straight necks with their much tinnier heads. There
were almost ten of them, uniformly spread all over the horizon,
watching him as if it were a way of mocking him for his failure.
    1999 turned his head down immediately. But as soon as he
did, there were sudden loud screams of shrieks and howls,
echoing through the gore air, borne from all directions. 1999 was
able to make up some of the unintelligible bone-chilling chatter—
more like desperate screams of requests. He identified most of
them as war cries and pleas of his superiors and screams of his
dying brothers. He knew that it was just dream, but the features
looked too sharp to be called a dream, but he didn’t three
struggle to wake up, for one; he hasn’t been sleeping for

   standard days, and two; he had been through this nightmare
almost everyday since three standard years, after the cruel and
sickening punishment he had received from Castro, and thus
became an adept to it.
    The red skies suddenly got darker but wasn’t completely a
night’s gloom yet, and 1999 looked up with some curiosity. The
bright red star's rays were blocked by an object hovering high in
the sky, creating a small eclipse. 1999 had never experienced an
eclipse before—neither in his dreams or on his stormy, cloud-
covered home planet Kamino. 1999 tried focusing on the
unidentified craft; he realized it was a Separatist Dreadnought-
class cruiser. Normally these massive capital ships were two
times the size as that of a Republic Acclamator, but with the
altitude it was flying at, it seemed to be only two inches from
1999’s perspective.
    The screams got louder, and this time, the words felt like a
constant call of his name. “03–1999?” 1999’s body began to
shake violently and his vision got blurrier and blurrier, as if he
was about to die in his dream and wake up in the reality.
“Wake up!”
     The rays of Ea, the Geonosian sun, fell like a cascade
of bright white rays in his initial moments of awakening.
As his arousing eyes adjusted to the light of actuality,
the skies seemingly turned pale, with the bright white
rays turning out to be the pale, yellow light rays of the
setting Ea; the same old surroundings of the backwater

world of the native Geonosians, except it wasn’t an old,
familiar surrounding : sandy, dry, desert-like surface,
receiving limited or little to no rainfall at all, tall catacomb-
like hives of the semi-sentient bug-like natives rising far
in the distance. Sounds of familiar chatters of a noisy
crowd vibrated his eardrums.
    1999 found himself sitting on a crate that resembled
the planet's nature and colour, with numerous other
wounded and tired infantry personals sitting on metal
containers and natural rocks along with many other triage
teams, pilots etc. It only took an instant to realise he was
in the vicinity of a Command Center. A rookie clone
trooper stood just a meter or two in front of him, with
numerous burns and scorch marks on his white armour
plate.
    “There you are!” The rookie greeted in despair and
anguish but 1999 snorted in confusion. Before he got to
respond, the clone grabbed 1999’s shoulders, and forced
him to stand up, “1999, listen to me… wh-what happened
to the rest of our squad!?”
    It didn’t took any more time for 1999 to realize who it
was. “2877, you, you are alive!” 1999 stammered, and
gave a silly chuckle, something that was very rare of him,
and it was sincere, “I thought you were—”
    2877 shook 1999’s shoulders, “Yeah, it's indeed
me…where is 8567….3443, and the rest…!?” 2877 asked
In an impromptu desperation, “Di-Did they make it?

    1999 gulped. The genuine happiness on his face fad–
ed away, “I am afraid they didn’t….”
    2877 slowly let go of his friend's shoulders, and a do–
wncast look took over his face, hidden under his helmet.
The rest was obvious.
    An LAAT/i gunship dropped on the ground behind
2877, manifesting a small cloud of the sand particles
around itself as it landed. 1999 realized there were few
more gunships and numerous fighters as well, surroundi–
ng the circular wall of the Command Post.
    2877 remained silent, and so did 1999.
    “Alright Group C! Move in! Move in!” Ordered the
Sergeant, waving his hand towards the gunship that just
touched the ground. These LAAT-series gunship proved
to be immensely successful just like other creations of the
Rothana Heavy Engineering. Despite many of them were
shot down in the air during the start of the invasion, the
overall performance was quite impressive. With the total
capacity of thirty passengers and 30 kg cargo, the
gunships proved to be surprisingly fast and manoeuvrable
for its size. The gunships were heavily equipped with
weapons : laser cannons and turrets, wing-mounted
rockets, rear-mounted missile belts and missile launchers.
    1999 slowly turned and left the scene, heading
towards his ride. Looking back, he could see 2877 frozen
on his place—for a long moment—before turning around
and mimicking 1999, his fist clenched and head down in

          
rage and regret.


Captain Lead of the 21st Legion trudged towards the
wreckage of one of the many Droid Core Ships, escorted
by Corporal Ree and two other ordinary foot-soldiers.
Lead's unrehearsed promotion felt like a red alert to Lead
himself. Were the Jedi really capable of leading an army?
Sure, he wasn’t judging an entire Order just for one
impromptu decision made by only one member of the
Council. But after learning that the Jedi Order had used
Commandos as infantry infuriated Lead a bit. And it surely
wasn’t an acolyte who made the decision, it was Master
Yoda himself, the highest council member of the Jedi
Order who organized the battle.
    The battle of Geonosis should have been relatively
easy, it could have been a guaranteed Republic victory, if
it wasn’t for the cringe tactics of their Jedi Generals. Had
Lead been the strategist, he would have created a
blockade first, then he would have ordered a full scale air
assault with the remaining cruisers, then finally the
cavalry along with the infantry, unlike the Jedi who did
just the opposite, and took far more lives than it should
have. However, Lead and his brothers were loyal enough
to follow their orders, and decided to remain silent.
    Lead stopped near a dispatched triage team of medics
and engineers, almost a half kilometre apart from


gigantic wreaked circular mass of the burned enemy Core
Ship.
    A rookie inspecting the damage turned abruptly to
face the battle-hardened Captain. “Lieutenant Bin under
your orders, Captain.” The rookie squared his shoulders
and saluted him.
    Lead saluted back, although confused. The default
armour with the lack of any colour markings indicated
that the clone had been nothing more than another foot
soldier, but his statement stated otherwise. “I am sorry,
but who are you?”
    “I am CT–3476 of the 21st Legion, Sir!” The Lieutenant
gave a stern reply.
    “Wait, what?” Lead muttered. “How did you ranked
up?”
    While trudging towards the Command Centre through
the blinding sandstorm, Lead and 21st were under attack
of a small Separatist Battle Droid Legion. During the start
of the ambush, Lead had ordered three ordinary clone
troopers and a medic to get Bacara and other two
wounded personals far from the blastefire while Lead and
the rest kept the droids busy, buying enough time for the
triage team to evacuate. 3476 was the group leader,
armed with only a Sniper rifle and a blast shield to protect
his squad.
    “It was General Ki-Adi-Mundi, Sarge. I initially denied
the offer, but he insisted on taking it.”

 
     Lead thought for some time.
     “And it should be noted that he seemed to be in a
hurry and was a bit desperate about it.” Bin added with
hints of hesitation.
     Lead noted, and there was an awkward silence
afterwards. Perhaps, he was right. The General wasn’t fit
for leading a legion. The Jedi were said to be
compassionate, but Lead feared that too much compassi–
on would degrade the troops’ morale.
     “Sir, l feel like it isn’t the right time to discuss about
it.” Ree whispered to Lead.
     The Captain nodded and said, “Alright, back to work,
has the Ground search and rescue team completed
scavenging the debris?”
     “Ongoing sir,” Replied the Lieutenant, turning back to
the scanners, “Please wait.”
     Lead turned left to see numerous more destroyed
Core Ships and scattered debris of battle droids and other
Separatist fighters, stretching kilometres after kilometres,
with many other Republic rescue teams scavenging the
debris in the distance. In the West, there were three
gigantic Republic Acclamators, getting boarded by
artillery vehicles, cavalry and exhausted soldiers. Above,
two smaller Republic cruisers hovered at an altitude of a
thousand feet, while the gunships carried new troops to
the Command Centre behind to change shifts as the
fighters escorted them, while some others patrolled for


any suspicious enemy movements.
    “Well, how much longer are we stuck here?” Lead
turned back to Bin.
    “Umm, well, after the Confederacy retreated, the fleet
admiral had given us an E.T.A. of ten hours… and…” Bin
swapped his hands on the holo-image, without turning to
Lead, “.. Well, we gotta stay here six more standard
hours, should everything go well.”
    Lead nodded, turning his head right. Nightfall would
be in less than an hour. The skirmish had created mist of
toxic gases of ion cannons, smokes and lasers, that
condensed and melded perfectly with the carnage’s
wreaks to form an oddly beautiful scenery of the
upcoming twilight.
    There were audible Pew–Pew on Bin's holodeck, with
one of its many buttons flickering with red light.
“Scramble line encrypted, notify please.” Bin mumbled
through the radio.
    “Zeta squad to sub–Command Post 45/157. No surv–
ivors detected on Core Ship, sector 45. Requesting perm–
ission to withdraw further search.”
    “Sub–Command Post 45/157 to Zeta squad, permiss–
ion granted. Any targets of interest?”
    “Negative, sir. Only scrap piles and some dead geon–
osians. None important political leaders.”
    “Good job, commandos. You may cease the search.”
Bin focused his eyes straight at the wreak of the Separ–

          
aratist. Just a minute or two later, he could see four blue
glowing dots emerging from the dark passage of the core
ship from half a mile away.
    Bin asked without turning, “Captain, how do the
Commandos go on stealth with those crystal-like glowing
eyes? They could be spotted from miles away!”
    Lead gave an annoyed reply, “Just do your work,
Lieutenant. We need not worry about that. And to begin
with, l honestly don’t know.”
    It was finally nightfall, the busy Command and sub–
Command Centers far behind lit up like a unbroken line
of markets in the horizon. Even the simplest of
phenomena like this were hard for the clones to
experience while on Kamino, as most of their daily
activities were spent by living with the pressure of
constant, break less trainings, isolated from most of the
galaxy.
    “So, sir. What do you came here for?” Bin asked with
usual annoyance.
    Lead gave a weary sigh and replied a bit rudely, “My
apologies, I don’t really like wasting my breath like that.
Let them arrive here first.”
    The four eventually came, looking as if in robust
health and discipline with their shiny, bulky armour and
crystal glowing visors.
    “A trio of three Republic Capital Ships were deployed
from Kamino for an emergency.” Lead started explaining


sharply before the four could even stop “While en route
for Courascant through the Corellian Run hyperspace
lane, the Tipoca City command lost contact with the fleet.
Their last successful transmission were approximately
two hours ago, near Aridus in the Expansion Region.
   “ The Republic since has been trying to investigate on
the near Itkotch and Tynna but to no avail yet. All except
the Separatist controlled Aridus. The Republic High
Command has ordered you to discrete and search for the
lost fleet on that planet Am I understood?”
    “Sir, wouldn’t it be better for us to leave for Aridus
only after the investigation on the other two worlds be
complete.” Asked the squad's demolition expert.
    “It’s urgent, trooper. We can’t let the Seps capture
the fleet admiral.” Replied Lead, and the four nodded.
“Alright Zetas,” He gestured towards a Republic Juggern–
aut truck. “Get in the caravan. Your advisor is waiting for
you in the Central Command Centre. The planet's
geography and rest will be discussed there. Move!”


The Gunship 1999 had boarded was almost full, yet there
were almost no chatter from anyone on board. It was
only from the second batch outside the gunship, in the
warmth of the Command Centre, who arrived in this
world recently after their redeployment from Courascant
as a replacement for the tired, exhausted and wounded

         
first batch of Geonosis as a second shift. It was almost
dark and there was a sudden drop in the temperature as
the sun fell in the horizon.
     The Gunship had two rows connected parallel to each
other, each row equipped with ten seats facing opposite
to each other. 1999’s row had seven foot soldiers facing
straight towards the Command Centre. The opposite row
was full with dead silence. Just like the second batch,
most of the first batch had been full of enthusiasm and
curiosity after hearing about going offworld for their first
mission, until it was shredded to pieces by the war's
carnage.
     1999 turned his head right; 2877 sat an empty seat
apart from him, his body motionless in shock and
drowned in regret. He hasn’t been talking for an nearly
an hour. 3443 had been his closest since eight years, the
bond between the two were exactly like those between
two brothers. His death had been the hardest. 1999 felt
that this still just wasn’t the right time to talk.
     “So,” 2877 talked with crippling depression, “I guess
we won.”
     1999 turned his head back at his companion, “That's
what I heard.”
     2877 nodded, “Doesn’t feel like we did.”
     “This is the cost of victory, brother.” Informed 1999,
his voice mimicking 2877’s tone. “The aftermath.” He
gave a sigh, “Can’t imagine how much worse a defeat


would have felt like.”
    The two paused, then 2877 asked, “Now what?”
    “I heard we are going to get reassigned to a legion.
Either on Courascant or on Kamino.”
    The door suddenly sealed shut and the yellow-green
lights of the cabin turned on. He could now hear and feel
the vibration of the gunship's roaring engines. And only
seconds later, it lifted off from the surface. 1999 could
feel the ground feeling beneath him.
    A minute or two later, the intercom advised in Basic,
“On behalf of Commander Ponds, we are congratulating
you for your first successful victory in Geonosis. It's not
everyday that you are successful in the annihilation of a
Droid Foundry and in the occupation of an entire world.
    “To everyone on board, after you arrive at Tipoca City,
Kamino, you are to immediately report to medical bay 33,
base 1468, medical check-up. That is all, out.”



First Year

The Cold War between the Galactic Republic and the
Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS) has officially
begun. After ten years of brutal training, the Clone soldi–
ers of the Republic have achieved their first victory
against the Confederacy’s Separatist droid army, mark–
ing the beginning of the Clone Wars…


As the attack shuttle flew through the hyperspace lane,
RC-02-1156 observed the squad of Clone Commandos
with whom he shared the shuttle. In the darkened but
clean and hygienic cabin, three others sat waiting for the
shuttle to land on the surface of the Separatist-controlled

Aridus. He could sense the atmosphere around his squad
just by the sincere silence. All of them looked imposing
with their heavy armour. But inside the glowing blue
visors of their helmets, their minds raced with thoughts
of fear of failure, fear of death, fear of losing their squad
and most importantly, fear of the unknown. He was too.
Textbook pre-battle anxiety huh? The Captain told hims–
elf. Happens to even the best of us.
     It was until RC-8898, the most intelligent squad-
member of the other three, broke the silence. “So, what's
the plan, boss?”
     RC-8898, or rather Sgt Lance was the brain of the
squad and the Captain's second-in-command. Despite
often serving the squad as a skilled tactician, Lance had
often proven himself as a skilled trooper who's slightly
humorous as well, in demanding 
times.
     “I was about to brief that,” RC-02-1156 responded,
while reaching out for his small holoprojector, “Alright
Zetas, listen up.” The Captain held the circular, cold,
metallic mass of the holoprojector tightly between the
enclosed fingers of his left hand. The handheld device
turned on, and rays of blue lights illuminated the cabin.
The holoprojector started displaying a 3D hovering image
of the planet and as well as its grid coordinates as it fed
everything with strong blue filter.
     The entire squad became attentive as the Captain
started speaking, “The Republic Intelligence has comple–


ted its investigation on Tynna and Itkotch with the local
authorities. The search was futile.” The Captain sighed,
and then declared as he changed the holographic image
to a young human female clad in a silver-tinted overfold
tunic, with cover and a standard blast plast-leather belt,
and a hair bun, as it were a strict dress code, “This is
Captain Bragg, the fleet admiral of the lost trio of three
Republic Acclamators,” He then abruptly turned off the
holoprojector, “That’s all I have to say…Now, you all
know what to do.”
    “Um, the mission’s complicated without a distress
signal or call to help us navigate.” Lance objectified with
his arms crossed, making the report sound unnecessary
ominous, “Mere assumptions won’t help, we need more
stronger evidences, Bruin.”
    “I know Lance, it’s ridiculous,” The Captain said with
a sigh, then turned to the squad’s medic and second-hand
technician, “Remember the calculations I made you do,
Brawl ?”
    Brawl, the most uncomplicated and least talkative
member among the quartet, leaned forward onto his
seat, sitting with his elbows resting on his knees, “Sir!”
    Bruin turned back to Lance, and turned on the holog–
ram back again with the imagine of the multi-terrestrial
Aridus hovering on top of the cold metallic surface of the
hologram. The Captain then inserted Brawl's calculatio–
ns into the device's software and only a few seconds later,


a red dot appeared on the planet's northern half near the
equator. Bruin zoomed the dot by scrolling his hand on
the hologram image and soon, the geographical features
became clear : a barren plain appeared, enclosed within
a boundary of multiple hills and small mountains with
limited plant growth. The area was marked by the name
Mægā Hills written in Aurebesh.
    “Are you certain that’s where the crash occurred?”
Lance asked, as he turned to face Brawl.
    “I can assure you that,” Replied Bruin, as he turned
off the hologram, “Brawl's calculations are most precise.”
    “Any idea why we chosen for this,” Lance complained
after a moment as he leaned back on his seat.
    “I dunno Lance, but at least it’s an op.” The Captain
replied with a chuckle, although he knew the answer very
well. Everyone on-board did. The Zeta squad along with
some other squads were responsible for infiltrating and
destroying numerous droid hangers back on Geonosis
which later played a key role for the Republic infantry in
winning the first battle of the Clone Wars. He also knew
why Lance was somewhat exasperate; the tactician alm–
ost died twice in combat back there on Geonosis : once
nearly missing a shot and then, getting aimed at his left
shoulder. But thanks to the heavily durable Kartan-class
armour that the Commandos wore, Lance lived to fight
another day with little difficulties as the blaster bolt didn’t
even penetrate more than two mere millimetres.
   Husk, the fourth member of the squad, remained quiet


throughout the conversation, much to everyone’s suspis–
ion. The otherwise dryly humorous demolition expert
remained serious in his duties as he checked the equipm–
ents and loaded ammos and cells in his rifle.
    “Why so serious, Husk?” Asked the tactician, “Your si–
lence always has made me uncomfortable.”
    “Just trying not to get you 'almost-killed' again.” The
brute weapon specialist replied with his deep, brittle
voice, mounted by his broken, battle-hardened accent.
    “You know, it just doesn’t suite your character.”
    “Haven’t met a human woman in my entire life so just
trying to be a bit professional about this.” He replied
sharply, without turning his face, “But then again, I am
not interested in romance at all. It’s creepy and cringey.”
    “So, you did heard the briefing.” Lance forced an
exhale after letting Husk finish his statement. He never
has been a fan of his dry humour.
    “Simultaneously as I did my duty.” Husk offered.
    Lance sighed, “Just don’t be a jerk out there.”
    “Never have been to anyone other than my own sq–
uadron.” He paused, then informed, “And most of the
time, it were you guys who asked for that, alike now.”


TIPOCA CITY COMPLEX
KAMINO
Three standard years prior to the formation of the first
Galactic Empire, Kamino was something more than just a


random planet in the Extragalactic region of the Outer
Rim Territories. It was something more than just another
aquatic planet—it was the birthplace of the clones,
populated otherwise by a group highly intelligent sentient
spices that were responsible for the creation of the Grand
Army of the Republic (GAR) : the Kaminoans. The glassy
eyes, long necks, and sleek bodies of the tall bipedal
indigenes spoke to a marine past, though in fact they had
been land dwellers for millions of years preceding a great
flood than had inundated Kamino. With global catastrop–
he looming, most technology advanced species would
have abandoned their homeworld and reached for other
habitable planets. But the Kaminoans had instead consc–
tructed massive stilt cities that were completed even as
the sea levels grew and started submerging their previo–
usly land based homes as more and more glaciers melted
due to global warming. They had also turned their cons–
iderable intellect to the science of cloning as a means of
ensuring the adaptation and survival of their very species.
Although the pale, white skinned natives tend to keep
themselves isolated from rest of the galaxy and use its
own untapped resources as a means of their survival, the
sentients did started working but for the very wealthy
only in the preceding decades from the present. After all,
only the foolish will ignore to admire the biological and
engineering knowledge of the Kaminoans.
    The inner complex of cloning facility situated near
Tipoca City, the capital of Kamino itself was like an artis–


tically crafted brilliance of Kaminoan tech. Although the
bipedal species lacked skills in aviation, their perfecti–
onism in their own intellect was enough to gain the adm–
iration of even the best of the Ship Building Companies
and numerous other engineering companies.
     The walls and floors of the military complex on which
1999 stood upon, waiting in a line with his fellow brothers
were clean, hygienic and were sparkling white under the
brightly lighted complex. The floors were made out of
strong, continuous and unbroken slabs of marble and was
supposedly even sand resistant as none of the dust
particles on 1999’s boots created a single stain or even a
scratch on the glittering, clean surface. It has been nearly
ten standard hours since he has lifted from the surface of
the backwater world. Two hours since his medic check-
up has been completed. Since then, he has been here
standing in the line, with numerous familiar voices ringing
onto his eardrums.
     All of the men standing with him were his brothers.
There were over millions of them—same heart, same bl–
ood. All of them were basically just the same person, and
yet they were all nothing but strangers to him. Some
carried a look of enthusiasm on their faces, some looks
of ruefulness, few psychopathic, while few simply nothing
…like 1999 himself. But one thing was sure… that all of
them were brave, selfless and loyal warriors—or at least
most of them, no matter how rough they were.
     The lone trooper turned his head around and scanned


the surroundings : more than twenty rows of soldiers
circled around a large deck, standing in huge lines as
each waited to be enlisted to specific divisions. The entire
complex was breath-taking and was hauntingly beautiful.
The ominous, cold yet calm ambience blended perfectly
with the bright and crystal white light rays falling on the
numerous blue translucent glasses of the bridges above,
with cadets marching with a Kaminoan who 1999 thought
to be their mentor, though far too away for him to make
out any details that might indicate his or her gender.
Looking up, 1999 assumed the height of the complex to
be approximately two kilometres from the floor. The
atmosphere would seem more or less like a secret lab
rather than a military complex to random outsiders.
    Though many of 1999’s brothers had a strong bond
with this world, referring it as their home, 1999 had bad
memories about Kamino, especially the training centres
and live-threatening methods techniques Castro had used
on him that vastly differed from the stressful but non-
lethal techniques used on other trainees.
    He could see the line in front of him winding as more
and more troops trailed from the front with documents in
their hands. Eventually his term came, with an entire
army behind him patiently waiting for their own.
    “Alright Rook,” the client remarked, “Show your left
wrist.”
    1999 proceeded as he was told, stretching his arm
through the scanner.


    1999’s status appeared on the viewscreen within sec–
onds. The client then gazed at the floating, holographic
databank of 1999 and gave him a frankly surprise look,
“Here it says that you have been a Commando…”
    “… Once.” Added 1999.
    “Really? Your armour isn’t beefy enough.” The client
claimed charmingly.
    1999 hesitated and then decided to be honest, “Well
actually that’s because my squad was demoted to a nor–
mal infantry long before Geonosis.”
    “Well, that’s just messed up…please elaborate your
recent trek on Geonosis.” The client requested as he read
the documents scattered on his desk.
   It took three full minutes for 1999 to finish explaining
the events he endured during the last Zero Hour, as well
the extermination of his squad due to a harsh drop.
    “Hmm,” The client exhaled and looked down for a
moment, “Alright, soldier. Congratulations! You are being
enlisted to the 21st Legion.” He then handed 1999 his
document card, “And be careful, Commander Bacara do–
sen't approve of sloppiness or laziness in his troops.”


Bacara, the infantry Commander of the 21st exhaled
slowly as he sat on the medical bed with his back straight
but not stiff. Satisfied, he scooped the dry serviette sitting
animatedly near his left, and rubbed it against his neck,
torso and arms to further dry himself up.


    The Commander had spent the last ten hours in the
healing agents of a bacta tank and remembered his bare
torso aching because of the rapid healing of bacta that
stretched his skin to form layers over his wounds, with
his ribs shifting back into their original posture. He also
remembered the sound of his own breaths as he exhaled
in his breathing mask during the medical procedure that
saved his life. Although now he was healed completely,
his mind was still numb with thoughts of the pain inflicted
back on Geonosis by the tracks of the droid tank that
rolled up to him from behind and flattened him with its
weight.
    A medical droid hovered in, bringing the ‘now-healthy’
Commander his thin jumpsuit . The suit smelled of disin–
fect and had a sharp, white contrasted Republic insignia
printed on it, that covered its entire chest. Nothing out of
ordinary. The Commander told himself as he put on the
black under-armour. It covered his entire body from neck
to bottom, sparing only his head and hands.
    Bacara leapt onto the polished surface of the medical
room and looked around. The entire cell was black-tinted
and was cleansed in dept. He turned to a bunk in front of
him, with his body suit flat on its surface. He approached
the plastoid armour and attempted to wear it : chest-back
and fully sealed leg armour, boots and pads. But where
were the wrist gauntlets and shoulder pads?
    As he was about to start searching for the missing pa–
          STAR WARS : GALACTIC MARINES : GENESIS         27

rts, he suddenly heard an audible thut-thut that he beli–
eved came from behind.
     Turning to the door, he found a clone trooper leaning
on its edge like a Duro bounty hunter. The red stripes on
his armour indicated that he carried the rank of a Captain.
     “Yes?” Bacara asked quietly.
     The captain straighten himself up, and cleared his
throat, “Commander, you don’t need those armour now”
He said with a croaked, menacing voice, “All you need to
do is.. Follow me.” The un-helmeted Captain turned to
the door, hoping for the Commander to stick behind him.
     The look on the stranger’s face was somewhat serious
and psychopathic. He was tall and identical to Bacara hi–
mself, but the Captain’s look was more masculine, more
menacing and blood-thirsty. His voice, especially, told as
if something horrible was about to happen. Or maybe it
was just his nature. But the look was still a bit unsettling
to even hard-core and strict leaders like Bacara.
     The Commander narrowed his eyes in suspiciousness,
“Where are you taking me?”
     The Captain stopped and hesitated, but then declared
in a deep voice, “To solitary confinement.”
     A shock came to Bacara’s face, but he tried hiding it
to maintain his professionalism though his reaction was
still obvious, “For what!?”
     The Captain snorted, and it was obvious that he was
more of a ‘no-nonsense’ leader than Bacara ever was,
“Maybe, if you don’t want to make matters worse, then I


recommend that it might be significantly better for us to
hurry up and not keep our creators waiting by trying to
organize a debate here…” The Captain replied sharply
and seemingly didn’t care to respect the Commander for
his rank, and he didn’t need to either. After all, he wasn’t
a part of the 21st Legion anyway, “.. Commander..” He
added and turned away, as if leaving the Commander to
make his choice.
    Bacara never wanted to become a target of the Kam–
inoans' prying eyes and thus never defied orders. He
hesitated for a slight moment, and then trailed off behind
the captain, his mind still deep in shock for the impromptu
news, though he was confident that this was the best and
only decision he had. And denying it would be most
unwise.


ARIDUS
EXPANSION REGION

The trio of the elite commandos of Zeta squad walked
with medium, swift strides down the woods. Their boots
made audible crunches as they walked on the fallen and
decayed leaves. Brawl was leading the expedition, his
gaze fixed on the viewscreen that he held with his left
hand while simultaneously making sure not to bump
himself with any of the tree trunks or stumble on a rock.
He was followed by the Captain beside him looking out
for any kind of hostiles or booby traps using his BTASD
torch. The demolition expert two meters behind had a
hard time maintaining his pace with the other two as he


looked behind frequently to ensure that the squad wasn’t
being pursued by spies.
Lance, the squad’s fourth member however, stayed be–
hind, guarding the vessel that had brought them to the
surface.

Just as the shuttle lifted off from the surface of
Geonosis, Bruin's holoprojector sprung to life and a realtime hologram image of a clone advisor ejected from the
handheld device.
“Alright Zetas,” the advisor began, “Sorry for keeping
you waiting. As you know, the Republic has been searc–
hing for a lost Republic fleet in the Outer Rim…”
The Captain of the squad waited for the advisor to fin–
ish the briefing, and then asked purposefully, “Sir what
exactly is the comm situation?”
“An important question indeed,” the advisor remarked,
“Though this planet’s native population is scarce, it is still
of great significance to the Separatists as this world
enjoys one of the galaxy’s finest Inter-galactic network.”
He paused, then warned, “You must avoid the usage of
long-range communication. Is that clear?”
“Sir, if we avoid using Holonet, how will we be able to
navigate the location?” Lance, the squad-tactician asked.
“Sarge, I understand your doubts, but to be frank, we
have yet to receive a distress call.” The advisor inform–
ed, “Is it because the survivors are taken as POWs—or
because of the planet's strong network resistance—we


can’t comprehend.” He paused for a moment, “For you to
navigate the crash site without triggering the radar, you
must pinpoint its location before breaching the atmosph–
ere, and before triggering foreign foes.”
There was an awkward silence afterwards. The Captain
turned to Lance, who only gave a shrug.
Captain Bruin’s face lit up with revelation, “Sir, and how
shall we pinpoint the target without the help of a GPS?”
“You need theoretical calculations and geographic kn–
owledge of the hyperspace lanes and the topography of
Aridus itself to complete this task,” The advisor continued
“the local timing of the planet when the fleet lost contact
and its orbital period as well.
“Every bit of information and info will be delivered to
you in ten standard minutes. The range of communication
is yet to be known, but to be on the safe side, avoid using
it at all costs, even with those between squad-mates.
“When you breach the atmosphere, you must cut you–
rself from all kinds of external communication. I will
inform the pilots to jam down signals before the drop.
Good luck commandos! You have thirty-two standard
hours to complete this task. Prove your excellency!”
“Ner vod,” Bruin remarked, switching off the holoproj–
ector, “Let’s hope the events play out as planned.”
The three had been walking for five standard hours si–
nce the vessel had touched the surface of Aridus approxi–
mately eleven klicks away from what seemed like the



crash site, passing through arid plains, woods and even
dense forests at rare times.
Brawl abruptly came to a stop, and met the Captain
eyes.
“Why have you stopped?” Asked Bruin.
The medic glanced at his viewscreen once again before
admitting, “Sir, the Beacon indicates that the crash site is
somewhere near us.” Brawl then shrugged to the front as
a gesture, “But we have yet to discover any physical
evidences.”
“What do you mean by 'somewhere’?”
“A mile from here. Judging by the mass of the Acclam–
ators, the extension of the debris or even the edge of an
entire chunk should’ve stretched upto here.”
Bruin waved his torch through the air, “Or is it possible
that the ship was captured by the Sepps mid air.”
“Certainly.”
The Captain nodded, “Why have you stopped then?”
“Just wanted to make sure we gear ourselves up before
engaging with any hostiles.”
“Yes, Sir, I'm worn out as well,” Husk stretched his
words from behind, “We have been walking since dawn.”
The Captain looked around and declared, “We can use
the bottom of that ridge as a bivouac.” He said as he ges–
tured towards a steep, mountain cliff at his right.
The other two admitted, on the contrary that it would
last for only a half-hour.

The campsite was open-aired as one would expect : no
tents or covers to shelter the men from the coming storm.
And they didn’t need one.
Husk and Brawl sat together on a natural crate with
algae growth on the upper surface of the silver-tinted
rock. Their helmets made an audible hiss as they unlatc–
hed the seal.
The medic then took out a foodpack from his backpack
and opened it : a column of ten thin, tasteless ration bars.
An average human clone aged twice that of a human, and
thus needed to consume twice the same amount of
calories as that of the normal human. Thankfully, a small
pack of the energy bars fulfilled all those needs and a
single chunk was enough to nullify the hunger for five
hours. Plus, clone commandos were military personals
and could even live without them for an entire week,
though they would be worn out by that point and would
cease to perform at maximum effectiveness.
Bruin towered over another rock, facing opposite to the
other two, not bothered by the soft sound of the food
bars getting crunched between the teeth of the hungry
men. He spread his body armour flat on the surface and
checked its vacuum integrity with the sweep sensor in his
glove, recalibrated helmet systems, checked heads-up
display, and other electronics that protected and maintai–
ned his armour's durability.
From the corner of his right eye, the Captain saw the
medic standing up from the crate, helmeting himself and
then began inspecting the sheer cliff towering behind.



“Hey,” Bruin called out without turning his head, “Over
here, Brawl.”
The medic obeyed, and reported to the squad-leader's
orders immediately—like a loyal Ranchor falling to his
master’s feet.
“I need you to scout out the area for any evidences or
booby traps, if you are done with lunch.” Bruin said as he
flipped his BTASD torch for the medic to catch mid-air,
“Just don’t go too far. And try to come back within twenty
standard minutes.”
Brawl took his attentive posture: “Understood.”
He cautiously walked his way through the bushes for
the next ten minutes, wary of the time and the storm
building above. Abruptly, he came to a clearing, that led
to the top-edge of a steep cliff only six meters from where
he was standing. But it wasn’t the height that attracted
Brawl, but what stood at the lower levels.
He swiftly crouched his way through the dry, browntinted surface of the clearing, and advanced towards the
edge as if he was on the brink of running. He came to a
stop just behind a giant, stationary rock that resembled
its vicinity, and peeked his head for a see-through : a lush
green forest was enclosed within plateaus and several
mountains, including the Mægā Hills where Brawl's squad
was now. But it wasn’t the ocean of greenery and its br–
eathtaking scenery that attracted the medic however.
At its heart stood a dome-shaped structure with its
walls carved with beautiful handcrafted marbles, altho–
ugh its tapering roof stood in stark contrast with the sp–
arkling white aesthetic walls.



The Commando took his DC-17m blaster rifle and per–
formed modifications on it to turn the interchangeable
weapon into a sniper's handiwork. He then peeked throu–
gh its scopes to get a clear look of the giant structure :
three-storeyed; with the bottom floor falling at the same
height as that of the tree line. The data on the scope's
visors indicated the height of the complex to be of appro–
ximately eight meters top-to-bottom and almost a kilom–
eter away from the ridge where he was crouched.
No doubt that it was a military complex as four landing
bays had emerged from each of the four sides of the mi–
ddle floor, starting from tall doors behind and tapering
halfway into five landing pads, hovering horizontally just
above the thick, beautiful treeline.
There was also little doubt that it was probably owned
by the Trade Federation, as the architects who built it
were clearly inspired by—or copied from—those of The–
ed, Naboo's capital city.
Also, the fact that it was probably built like an extrava–
gant artefact just to fulfil a wealthy Neimodian's lust for
luxury was undeniable, and so it was clear.
The four doors that stood almost as tall as those of
each’s perspective sides on the middle floor were also far
from negligible for even the most dependent of battle
droids.
He scanned the entire outer complex of middle floor
with the rifle’s scopes and found two empty droid
gunships parked on the landing pads of the bay that
tapered right towards Brawl, stopping halfway to form a
trapezium. The other one that faced North had only one



Vulture Droid parked on one of its five landing pads. And
the rest weren’t visible because of the angle Brawl was
standing at. He then peered his view into the tall door of
the only side that faced his direction. It was a direct
entry—or exit—to its landing pad.
Inside it were rows of multiple different rooms. And
since only three of them were visible to him, he had no
other option rather than to assume the rest. The arrange–
ment of the cells looked like a…a prison?
The interior of the cells were blocked by the opaque
walls, however. Hence, there was no possible way for a
solid confirmation, though those rooms could be cargo
cells as well. And as far as he could see, he noticed a long
black-coloured rod-like structure walking back into the
gloom of the hall that he was sure was a Super Battle
Droid. Though its real name and designation were unkn–
own to the Republic, they all saw it as a force to be recko–
ned with—far more durable than the average B1 battle
droids that were mass-produced by the Trade Federation
for the Confederacy—but far less independent than the
average battle droids of the Separatists, as seen during
Geonosis.
After there were nothing more left to see in the middle
floor, he went after the top one. It wasn’t as large as the
previous one—for… reasons he didn’t knew—though still
seemed to have enough space to forge a Command Post,
and was sufficient in area to house a couple fifty tall
Quermians without getting overcrowded. Brawl tried to
see through its windows but failed because of the glasses'
colour density. He could only make out glimpse of what


he thought of as a Console Command table.
Done… He then went for the bottom floor. But most of
it remained hidden beneath the line of thick trees. He
tried to peer through the gaps between leaves. It seemed
like there were no doors on the wall of the building’s side
that faced West—right towards him—but there were mul–
tiple small windows on it, or seemed like it were.
He then turned the rifle’s scope at the side that faced
North right at his left. But because of the peculiar angle,
it was almost impossible to scan it straight, though he
could see the edge of what he believed to be the groundentry to the building. And judging by the height where it
hanged, it was confirmed that the doorway was just as
tall as those that lead to the landing bays on the middle
floor. Leading to the doorway were two lines of trees with
beautiful purple leaves that stood in sharp contrast with
the green-leaved trees that outnumbered them, parallel
to the ridge where the commando-medic was standing.
They probably served as road-side decorations and stret–
ched for almost half a kilometre. And apparently it was
the only doorway that served as an entry—and exit—on
the ground floor as he saw no further odd decorations
like this one; and no other droid patrols as well.
He took his eagle eyes out from the scope and glanced
back at the structure with a quick, naked look. Now, all
he needed to do was just go and inform his squad—
There was a sudden whirl of roars above him that made
the medic jump. He hunched down in sudden shock and
looked above to see a Nantex-class Geonosian starfighter
heading straight down towards the landing pads just a



few two-hundred meters above his head, followed by a
Self-Propelled droid starfighter as an escort.
Oddly enough, none of the two fighters seemed to have
noticed Brawl hunched down a couple hundred meters
below as they maintained their pace without hesitation.
It was only after the roar of the engines reduced to
distant hums that the medic peeked his head up slowly,
assuring his privacy. He put his view back into the scopes
of his rifle. The grip on its handles felt reassuring.
The pair landed near each other on the bays that faced
North, right above the ground-level entry-way. The hatch
of the Geonosian starfighter opened as two small clouds
of smokes spewed out from exhausts on either sides.
Three figures emerged one after another, their arms
behind their heads. The first one to emerge was a human
male in his mid-forties, followed by two tall similar-looki–
ng men and finally two B1 battle droids with their blasters
out. It took him only a moment to realize who the POWs
could have been.
Brawl was running so late in time that there was no
doubt that Bruin had already begun searching for him.
But he didn’t care.

Better interception, stealthier discretion, quicker succ–
ess, and less casualties. He muttered under his breath.

The droids escorted the trio into the hallway leading to
the cells, disappearing from the medic's view. He waited
for a full ten minutes to see if they appeared in the hall
that faced his direction, but to no avail.

Enough.

He got up and began to slowly pace back into the bush,


crouching until he completely faded back into the thick
green leaves.
BASE 1468
KAMINO
Bacara maintained his pace with the impatient Captain.
Although it has been an hour and half since he got out of
the bacta tank, his legs were still somewhat ragged and
felt stiff. He thus had a hard time following the messe–
nger’s notoriously quick steps.
Time after time, he would almost stumble upon passer–
sby after his knees started to twitch out of the blue. But
now that, for quite a while, the nerveless sensation was
gone, he could gladly revert back into his normal attentive
posture: his eyes furrowed to show seriousness and his
military stance showing discipline as he stomped on the
smooth, reflecting floor of dim-lighted but clean, circularshaped hall, leading to a Self-Propelled door of the Tipoca
City Command Center.
The two were now close enough that the scanners pic–
ked up their heat waves and the hatchway opened by its–
elf, leading them to a small cell.
The Command Center was unbelievably small. Too sm–
all to be even called one. But though small, it was densely
packed with information and data. At the heart stood the
holodeck table that is often used as Command of fleets
within Kamino's atmosphere or in orbit. The walls were
completely filled with viewscreens that fed the operators
with real-time data about weather reports, while the


decks buzzed with reports of current status of the city's
Fusion Generator and Reactor Core.
The only people inside were two Clone Naval Ensigns
busy in their duties and responsibilities as Securities,
while Koi Sai, a female Kaminoan doctor conversed w–
ith another Clone Captain who wasn’t helmeted.
“You may now go,” She mildly gestured her hand towa–
rds the exit for the other clone to obey.
“Yes, mistress, you called for me?” Bacara asked, putti–
ng his hands behind his back.
Koi Sai turned to address her two visitors. But first she
gestured to the captain behind Bacara, “Please leave us
alone, CT-6569.”
The designation sounded somewhat similar to Bacara.
Familiar. Solid. T-that was… Faie!
A few six months prior to the crucible on Geonosis,
numerous clone troopers from each Legion, Battalion and
Corps were selected for superior training by some of the
best Mandalorian warriors to transform the otherwise
nameless, aimless men into commanding soldiers, to
make them superior to their more common brethren. And
this was exactly where all the Corporals, Sergeants, Lie–
utenants, Captains, Commanders and Marshall Comm–
anders had gained their official names. Bacara and him
were part of that training, though they were far from fre–
inds. Faie was the Kaminoans' favourite because he
followed orders no matter how gruesome they were and
enjoyed them; a perfect soldier from the Kaminoan's
perspective. Strict and cruel, he often had been even
willing to submit his own brothers who were indiscipline



for execution, without feeling any remorse.
None of the clones seemed to like him however, not
even loners like Bacara himself, or his own men.
“Yes, Sir!” Captain Faie addressed and turned to the
door without hesitation.
“Now, I suppose you are CC-1138, the Commander of
the 21st Legion.” She admitted softly with her chillingly
thin tone.
Koi Sai was the Chief Scientist of Kamino and was one
of the many biological engineers responsible for the
creation of the Clone Army. Though she seemed gentle
and docile on the outside, her actual personality was far
from that: it was disturbing and cold. Not cruel, but cold.
Five years prior to Geonosis, Bacara had heard rumours
and stories about a batch of clones who possessed less
than the required vision of an ordinary human. Though
this abnormality wasn’t detected until some of them grew
older and began showing its side effects. Bacara knew
one such clone who was in fact a cadet in his group. Midway through their training the abnormality of the youth
became public to the Kaminoan during drill trainings. And
as such Koi Sai herself came to the genetically mutated
cadet and offered him a cure. He accepted it but was
never seen or heard of again. The remaining members
from Bacara's pod—who are now officially regarded as B–
acara's Fist—believed their unfortunate brother was
terminated.
Back then, Bacara had been too fearful to ask her the
fate of his brethren. Now, he was rather too obedient for
that as he accepted his loyalty towards the Republic as a


Kaminoan property. But even eons later, the memories of
his missing brother still haunted him and the fact that his
fate was yet a mystery to Bacara and his squad made the
incident far more eerier and disturbing.
“Yes, ma’am.”
“And are you the leader of Bacara’s Fist?”
The Commander narrowed his eyebrows, “Absolutely,
ma’am. It goes by my name.”
Satisfied, she turned to the holodeck and took a view–
screen on her hands, “And you were also a participant of
the Clone-Captain programme.”
“Yes.”
The tall, sleek bodied bipedal then turned the holodeck
and punched a key into its screen and a moment later, a
hologram image of a BARC speeder came to life. Hovering
above the projector were five military tactics written in
Aurebesh that were related to the speeder in-subject.
“It has come to my notice that these are you and your
friend’s handiwork, aren’t they?” Koi Sai asked, craning
her neck.
Bacara's facial features loosened, “Yeah.. Me and Neyo
had been working together to establish new tactics and
strategies for the BARC speeders.”
Koi Sai remained silent however, looking back at the
hologram; curious.
“And I even have a specific handwritten permission for
that.” Bacara also informed.
Two months past, back during the drill sessions of the
Clone-Captain programme, Bacara was promoted to the
rank of a Captain. Since then, he had been on the lookout



for one accompany. Only one.
Everyday during lunch, he went for a search in the
cafeteria to find a partner that suited him best. For that,
he was always on the lookout for the best students in the
programme, which included Bacara himself.
The first he kept an eye on was Cody, the current lead–
er of the 212th Attack Battalion. Though Cody was the
most well-known student in his group, Bacara realised he
had a strong bond with Rex, another participant of the
programme, and that might create problems during
combat. Bacara needed someone who doesn’t form
strong bonds with their fellow comrades but still had the
potential of an ally.
Ponds was once his point of interest as well. But he was
just too nice for his taste. Faie could have been a perfect
suit, if he wasn’t an arrogant psychopath.
Bly could also have been good ally as he was the
perfect embodiment of ‘Duty comes before brotherhood’.
But he was just another by-the-book soldier.
Feeling defeated, Bacara gave up on his search. But
who knows what fortune he had stumbled upon when he
engaged with a lone Neyo in the cafeteria. And it wasn’t
Bacara who had found him. Neyo himself had come to
the former 21st Captain.
The otherwise lone 91st Captain had always kept an eye
on Bacara, though he wasn’t a stalker. Neyo agreed to be
friends with him on the condition that the two must avoid
forming a bond with each other and even anyone else, if
possible. Bacara wholeheartedly agreed not to, with the
exception of his personal squad.


Bacara was also heavily inspired by Neyo's statement :

Friends are a burden, Bacara. In our final moments, we
are all on our own.

Both later began innovating new tactics for the newly
built BARC speeders. Neyo being a skilled tactician helped
Bacara with his difficulties in forming strategies, while
Bacara taught his new partner few of the best martial arts
and fighting techniques he knew to improve Neyo's prow–
ess. The two became a strong and perfect duo.
It was a pity that despite being one of the best stra–
tegist, Neyo was so unrecognized and underrated. But
Neyo said he just liked keeping himself private. One day
after he surpasses the current Clone Commander Ponds,
he was certain he would be the second to be crowned as
leader of the 91st Reconnaissance Corps.
Neyo wasn’t technically a psychopathic or coarse in his
personality, but he lacked empathy and compassion. Yet
he was still calm, and calculating, just like Koi Sai herself.
She turned to Bacara again, “Actually I was about to
say that the new tactics that you have implemented on
the BARC speeders have proven themselves to be quite
resourceful during the Zero Hour on Geonosis. The auth–
orities have decided that you and CC-8826 are to be
handed the Medal of Honour for your work.”
Bacara's mind jumped in excitement after hearing the
news, but he concealed it to show his patience and profe–
ssionalism.
“On behalf of administrative Taun We, I congratulate
you for your accomplishments,” She stopped and then
turned back at the holodeck. She reached out for her long



hip pocket, and inserted a datacard into the holodeck's
slot. The Kaminoan scientist then punched a key-code
and the hologram image shifted to that of an armour.
Bacara looked at the hovering suit with visible interest.
The armoury was much similar to the Alpha-class ARCs
as it had a signature mouth piece, kamas and pauldrons
on both shoulders and even new customizations like syn–
thmeshs to keep out hazardous substances.
“Still in production.” Koi Sai informed.
“My new armour?” He asked, “A reward?”
Koi Sai showed a small hint of dismay at the Comma–
nder's inquisitiveness, but replied anyway. “Not exactly,
but a reward for men. Nine out of ten regiments of the
21st Legion that were deployed on Geonosis have surv–
ived the onslaught. The casualty count was indeed high,
but they have performed the best out of all other legions,
with the 501st as an exception.
“And thus, in this regard the Administrative Council of
Kamino has decided to have your legion trained by some
of the best Mandalorian trainers.”
Bacara ceased his smile, like he always did. Getting tr–
ained by a Mandalorian was an honour. “So, should I have
the 21st return back to Kamino–”
“Yes, but only half of it. Because the 21st are needed to
be deployed in the Rim Territories to suppress Separatist
movements. Keep the current best of your men for the
coming onslaughts while the others to be trained here on
Kamino.”
“It will be done ma’am,” Bacara said as he turned to
the door but was interrupted.



“You are not going anywhere, Commander,” The Kam–
inoan said, “You are required to stay here.”
Bacara’s jaw almost dropped. He turned back to Koi Sai
but didn’t say anything.
“Your reputation has come to the notice of Taun We.
She has recently orchestrated a new programme which
would turn standard clones like you into Advanced Recon
Commandos (ARC troopers), and she is counting on recr–
uiting you. Do you accept the offer?”
Bacara was successful in concealing his smile once
again, but failed to resist the slight hint of pride in his
voice.
Stiffening his legs and arms, he said, “I accept the offer,
ma’am! It is an honour to be selected as a part of it.”

And I promise, when the Republic calls for me, I will be
there to gladly defend and give my life for their cause, if
need be…
