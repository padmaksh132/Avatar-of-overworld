<h1>STAR WARS GALACTIC MARINES</h1>



<h3>“Keep your wits sharp and your blade sharper.”</h3>
<p>-Mandalore the Destroyer



Republic Command Post 4/135, Bon'sai District Aargonar, Perkell Sector, Mid Rim
Grid Coordinates : Q-7
Four Standard Months after Geonosis ....
RC-03/1999 sat handcuHed on the cold marble floor. Though blindfolded, he could feel the presence 
of fear of many of his brethren around him, mostly radiating from his two conflicted squad-mates, 
and the chilling presence of his otherwise screaming Sergeant.
“As I said earlier, you and your brothers are not born to serve Mandalor, you and your brothers are 
not born loyal to our cause.” He said coarsely but chillingly, “You are born
/oya/ only to the Republic, or you are not born at all!”
Pausing for a brief moment, the Mandalorian Instructor turned to one of his squad-mates, handed him 
a BlasTech- pistol and chillingly asked, “Remember, earlier, how you had sworn loyalty to the 
Republic through your speech, and disregarded our Mandalorian Culture. Now, I've given you a 
glorious oppodunity to prove your so-called loyalty. Execute the traitor. Fulfil your words.”
1999 could hear his friend—or rather, brother—gulp as he slowly raised the pistol and aimed for his 
head, his hands trembling in conflict and protest.
But, afler a few moments of hesitation, he gave up and
put the pistol down. He just couldn't do it. He couldn't kill
his brother.
“Hmm, this isn't how I expected it to end.” The Drill Ser— geant said pitifully, and took a few 
steps back.
1999 could hear the unmistakable reloading of another pistol—though not the same one he had been 
familiar with—and then, a blaster shot.
CT-03-1999 could feel the roughness of the soil as his blurry vision tried to focus in his wake; 
his paralyzed body beginning to show motion as he desperately tried to dril away from the edginess 
of the sleep.
1999 was laying face-first on the ground, and tried to push the soil back by using both of his 
arms, and got up to his knees. And all now he could see was what remained of the destroyed Command 
Post that he had been defending minutes earlier—or an hour earlier. He got the rusty vibes of the 
Stalgasin Hives and flashbacks of Geonosis. Fires engulfed the remains, with bodies piled up 
in-between, the land; barren and lifeless and the horizon; empty.
The helmet he wore suddenly beeped and the ear sensors
picked up rapidly approaching shuPles behind him.
1999 reacted swihly, and turned just in the nick of time to dodge the blow of a vibroblade , 
attached to the rod of a spear. The HUD of his helmet bleeped infront of his eyes, and enlightened 
the blade to be a Slaver Blade used by the Trandoshans to hunt and slaughter their Wookie slaves.
He staggered back and inspected the aggressor for a moment; a scaled, green skinned Trandoshan, as 
expected. Before 1999 could regain his composure, his reptilian op—
ponent puffed a series of ferocious attacks. 1999 dodged
the first three but it only angered his aggressor.
The Trandoshan blared and grew desperate, and slashed a direct but non-lethal blow, hoping his 
opponent to do a mistake. And 1999 — exhausted from previous combats — indeed did.</p>

<p>
The tired Republic soldier blocked the blow with his palms and even worse, he exposed his right 
knee for a kick.
The Trandoshan swung his feet and stomped on the sol— dier's right knee, causing him to stumble and 
fall helplessly on the hard, barren, rocky brownish soil. He then swung his spear and hit his 
defeated opponent's helmet right to let, knocking 1999 on the soil a few meters away, his back 
exposed to the evening sky. The ferocious Trandoshan raised his Slaver Blade for a killing blow, 
and 1999 now knew that he too would be added into the list of his fallen brothers.
Brizzf
1999 heard the sound of a dense blaster bolt hitting the scaled body of the Trandoshan, and turned 
almost instantly to see the ferocious reptilian freeze in shock, before dro— pping the spear from 
his hand and falling before 1999, with smokes coming out of the cauterized wound on his back.
1999 stood up and crouched to inspect the corpse. The HUD flickered and began scanning the fallen 
body's organs. The Ultrasound-movement sensors interpreted the heart beats, and a translucent image 
of still-beating heart of the reptile floated on the inner screen of his helmet's visor, indicating 
that the beast was still alive somehow.
1999 turned off the Ultrasound system and turned on the thermal vision. Now, 1999 had a clear view 
of the reptile's organ systems, with the slow regrowth of the wounded tissues—a biological 
prerogative characteristic particular in the species. 1999 grabbed a DC-15 blaster rifle lying near 
him and aimed at the centre of its cardiovascular system, and then, took the shot.
Looking up, he could see another Republic soldier—an elite Commando—the one that saved 1999’s life, 
walk up to him, looking down at the corpse.
“Thanks for saving my ammos.” The Commando said.
1999 ignored and got up to his feet, his gaze still fixed at


the lifeless scaled skin of the beast. It was dead indeed.</p>
<p>
“You listening?” The Commando asked, “Give me back my helmet.”
1999 now turned his attention towards the Commando,
who had the inflicting personality of a fierce Mandalorian warrior and an exceptionally deep voice, 
despite the two sharing the inheritance of the same template.
“Sorry, didn't exactly catch it.” 1999 asked; confused.
The helmetless commando pointed at 1999’s face, “The
helmet's mine, rook.”
1999 was about to start a mindless argument, when he realised that the Commando who stood in front 
of him was right. The helmet, that suited him fine moments earlier now felt oddly heavy, in 
contrast to the helmet he had actually been wearing for a whole four months and before.
1999 tried to unhelmet himself but the helmet remained
on his head stubbornly.
“Unlatch it, stupid.” The Commando became annoyed. 1999 punched a key near the Communications 
Hardware
and felt the helmet loosen its grip on his neck. 1999 unlat— ched it with a audible h/ssand took it 
between his palms in curiosity. It was really heavier and bulkier compared to the standard  clone  
trooper  armour  that  ordinary  infantry
troopers—like 1999 himself—wore and weighed about ten more kilograms. The visors in the front—that 
displayed tactical data to the wearers—glowed ghostly blue.
The ambient became more reasonable all of a sudden.
Without the Night-vision SYS, the sky looked darker in 1999’s naked eyes. It was almost night. The 
twilight was shedding its final rays of dusk. And It would have been significantly darker if it 
weren't for the burning inferno that engulfed the remains, radiating a mystical glow on the barren 
soil.
“C'mon! Hand it over.” The Commando said, and sna—
tched the helmet from 1999’s hands before the rookie even


had a chance to return it by himself.</p>
<p>
1999 gave almost no reaction, and by the time he looked up again, the Commando had already worn and 
sealed his helmet. He knuckled his neck-joints and gazed over 1999’s shoulder.
“There they are!” He exclaimed, and 1999 turned around to see two AT-RTs and a squad of medics 
approaching the Post from the far East, “The Evacuation pods have arrived!”
The Commando took a few steps forward and picked up a flare gun from the debris and motioned 1999 
to a full Clone trooper helmet lying on the soil near him. “Now, get professional and pick up your 
helmet.” He ordered Io1iIy, “And search for survivors.”
1999 obeyed. It was one of most painful things to do for most Clones: to search the bodies of their 
own brothers; to stare into the dead faces of yourself is such a haunting experience.
1999 picked up the scorched helmet and stared into its visors, then turned to glance the Commando's 
armour once more, and then turned back to the differentiate it with his armour. The visors looked 
dead without any fancy thermal or night vision technologies, and 1999’s armoury looked thin and 
pale in comparison to the Commando's bulky Katarn-class armour, despite being made from expensive 
plastoid metal and costing up to 5,000 credits in the Black Market.
1999 didn't get to see the face of his saviour, but he didn't
needed to. The Commando was a clone, just like 1999 himself, both bred artificially from the same 
template of Jango FeR, and thus sharing the same inherent traits, with some like Commandos  and 
Alpha-ARCs  having  more genetic modifications than the ordinary troopers. Staring at one of them 
would look like staring at yourself in a mirror from 1999’s perspective. The only difference 
perhaps was the aRitude and personalities distinct in each one of them.   
And in this case, the Commando had the pride of being
what he is, while 1999 just had a blank look on his face.
1999 looked back into the helmet's visors. He had been ordered by a superior brethren to wear it, 
but pal of him felt as if it was a disrespect to wear someone else's helmet, especially the one 
that belonged to a dead comrade.
1999 knew much more about the Commandos than any other normal infantry trooper as he once have been 
a Commando as well. It was eons ago, and the vague-ish dream just brought back some bad memories 
about it.
1999 didn't dive any fulher to undo his conflicted mem— ories. The more he thought about it, the 
more pain it caused. He once wore that armour too, that helmet as well. 1999 had been so engrained 
in his thoughts that he just ignored the roaring swi”sh of the flare gun's trigger and the bright 
orange hue that illuminated the evening sky, and even the reflection it caused on the visor's 
glass. And by the time, he came back to reality, the flare had already
worn out.
“You still standing there?” The Commando shouted, “Come on! Look for survivors.”</p>

Site 77, Separatist Bio-Research Facility
Corvis Minor IV, Ciutric Sector, Outer Rim Territories Grid Coordinates : N-5
Groshik watched in utter amusement as the two BX series battle droids dragged the unhelmet Clone 
Commando into the cell, and threw him downstairs into the chamber.
“Seal!” Groshik ordered the B1-class droid technician who along with five others operated the 
Control centre of the gas chamber. A Neimoidian, Groshik Lesser had been app— ointed by the 
Separatist Council as the Supreme Observer of Site 77, a secretive Bio-research facility situated 
am— ongst the densely lush mining world of Corvis Minor IV.

Standing alongside with his Vice Observer, were the Lead
      Scientist Dr. Uthan Buck, a human.
      “Roger Roger.”The Droid replied and sealed the chamber shut. And Groshik didn't need to repeat 
      anything else for the monotonous droids to interpret his intentions.
      The procedure occurred on its self now; the stage was set. The final part that was left was small 
      but intense as the B1- Droid pulled down what the Neimoidian referred to as the ’Handle of Death’.
      1e/the sfanphter bepin.
      Groshik thought as he watched through the CCTV the confused and terrified face of the prisoner as 
      vapours of toxins hovered down from the ceiling vent.
      Soon enough, the gas started filling the entire chamber as the trio heard the agitated coughs and 
      gurgles of the clone through the mic; a sound horrifying and nauseating for weak-hearted beings, 
      but authentic for those with a sadistic and vengeful mind-set.
      The Operation lasted for only a minute and less, but for the poor Clone, the painful experience 
      lasted for an hour. Eventually death caught him moments later: a merciful exit from a hellish 
      nightmare.
      The ritual was done now. But not Groshik's satisfaction.
      “Subject RC-15678; terminated.” The Droid informed, without turning its gaze from the Console Deck, 
      and Dr. Buck ordered the cell to be vacuumed.
      “A splendid success, isn't it?” Uthan admired her work coldly, and scribbled the observations on 
      her sweep, “From the last slaughter timing 75.5 secs to the recent being of only 30.65. Wat Tambor 
      would be impressed.”
      “Not yet, I believe in assurances.” The Neimoidian said gravely and jolted his arms as an order to 
      the two BX- series Commando droids to inspect the body.
      The two droids entered back into the chamber and Gros— hik eagerly waited for the repol to arrive. 
      And soon enough
      
      
      it did.</p>
    
<h4>“Search completed. Subject RC-15678 has expired.” The
      Droid Technician assured.
      RC-15678 was no more. And all that was left there was the lifeless body of a forgotten warrior, and 
      the grim and satisfied smile of a greedy, sadistic Neimoidian.</h4>
