      <h1>THE SAVER</h1>

        United States v. Barnes, 617 F. Supp. 2d 143 (D.D.C. 2015)
        When it comes to famous MCU fan fiction, few stories are as widely known as "United States v. Barnes, 617 F. Supp. 2d 143 (D.D.C. 2015)" and for good reason. The story, which was co-authored by fallingvoices and radialarch, is a masterclass in form and feel. The lengthy fic explores multimedia storytelling through social media, academic essays, and more. At its core, the story is set in a world where Bucky Barnes undergoes trial for his crimes as the Winter Soldier, and the gut-wrenching piece breaks down the public's opinions on the matter.

        We are standing at a historic moment in time. Right now, right here, we have the chance to lay to rest the ghost of not one, not two, but more than sixty different victims of murder. Some of these men and women have been waiting for more than half a century for justice to be brought to them. And now, thanks to the recently released SHIELD files, we are in the unique position to do so.</p>
      <p><h4>User Since</h4>
        "User Since" remains a classic fan fiction, focused on Phil Coulson, following its October 2013 publication. Written by rageprufrock, this innovative story plays with format and feelings like none other. It follows a group of Internet buddies in the wake of the Battle of New York. The group, which gathers on a Howling Commandos fan site, is searching for their mutual bud, Phil Coulson, and uncover a series of mysteries concerning their now-fallen friend.
        
        You can check out the story's synopsis below:
        
        <h4>To: PC (loyaltothedream@hushmail.com) <br>
          From: Buck (bucky1956@yahoo.com) <br>
          Subject: Report! <br>
          Date: May 10, 2012</h4>
        
        
        Phil — where the hell are you, man? Let us know if you're all right, or if there's anything we can do to help. HQ's freaking the fuck out.</p>   
        <p>Look the Devil in the Face
          "Look the Devil in the Face" is a slice-of-life story imagining one of the many ways Daredevil could enter the MCU. After all these years, the blind vigilante has yet to hit the big screen under Marvel Studios, but this fan fiction proves Matthew Murdock very much fits in. Written by prettybirdy979, it follows Matt as he encounters the Avengers one by one while they try to see if Daredevil is more monster than man... and it goes about as well as you'd expect.
          
          You can read the story's synopsis below:
          
          *****
          It's increasingly becoming a world where the unbelievable happens every day. The Avengers team includes a defrosted World War Two solider, a giant green rage monster and a man who might be a God; and they battle aliens and magic on a regular basis. It's not too far fetched to believe the Devil walks Hell's Kitchen.
          
          Matt, on the other hand, hasn't realised exactly why his new battle buddies seem terrified of him. It's not like they've even heard the rumors about him being the Devil... right?</p>
          <p>In the Home
            If you are ready to read some angsty stories about Peter Parker, aloneintherain has just the thing for you. "In the Home" follows the Avengers after they add Spider-Man into the fray, but things turn south when an invasion leads the team to turn against Peter. Locked in a room with deadly superheroes, Spider-Man must find a way to survive and work through the fallout when his team comes back to their senses.
            
            You can read the story's summary below:
            
            *****
            The Avengers have been infected, turned violent and aggressive against their will. And Peter, the only one unaffected, is trapped inside the Tower with six feral teammates.
            
            "Natasha," Peter says cautiously, "what happened here? Steve attacked me, and if there was ever a sign that something was wrong, it's having the embodiment of Truth, Justice, and the American Way throw you across the room—"
            
            Natasha comes closer, her stride controlled. Nothing necessarily out of the ordinary, but there's something in her face, in her eyes—
            
            Natasha lunges across the space, and slams into Peter, hard.
            
            The Act of Creation Will Be Your Salvation
            "The Act of Creation Will Be Your Salvation" is one of Tony Stark's most popular general stories to date. The story, which is written by scifigrl47, gives a different perspective on Iron Man. The story follows Tony from the beginning of Iron Man and hones in on his creation of robots like Dum-e and U. The surprisingly touching fic is completed, and it will leave a good number of readers teary by the end.</p>
