      <p><h4>Into the good night</h4>
"Into That Good Night" is an alternate-universe story wherein the MCU dabbles with Interstellar a good bit. Written by Nonymos, the story follows Captain America long after civilization peaked and fettered away its resources. The planet's only hope is to traverse space in hopes of finding a way to undo the damage humanity wrought, and a series of events leads Steve Rogers to volunteer alongside Bruce Banner and a mysterious dark-haired stranger he swears he's met before.
        
      </p>Steve Rogers has lived for entirely too long—long enough to see the world's end. The heroes are gone, and the Earth is pushing what's left of mankind towards the exit.

      But when a makeshift team rises from the ashes, when a mysterious presence all but drags Steve there, he begins to think there may be hope yet. As they shoot for the stars one last time, Steve will get proof yet again that the future is nothing if not an echo of the past.
      
      Revisionist History
      "Revisionist History" is a standalone story without any romances to explore. Instead, it follows a little-seen character from the MCU as Peter Quill's grandfather comes into focus. Written by hitlikehammers, the story follows Peter's grandfather in the wake of the boy's abduction. The older man writes a series of children novels to get over his grief, but Grandpa Quill never thought The Adventures of Star-Lord would become more fact than fiction.

      <h4>Maybe</h4>
      All he knows is that he can hear his wife's voice, his Minnie saying to him, clear as day:
      
      You should write it down, honey. You always have the best stories.
      
      And it's been months; it's pushing a year.
      
      It's been months, pushing a year, and he's still got his kids cooking him dinners he doesn't need.
      
      But now—now, maybe he's also got a story to tell.
      
      And maybe it'll help.
      
      Maybe it'll help if he writes it down.
      <p> <h4>Land of the Free</h4>
        Land of the Free
"Land of the Free" is penned by BeanieBaby on Archive of Our Own, and it gives an alternate telling of Avengers: Infinity War. Set after Black Panther, the story imagines what would have happened if Loki managed to use the Tesseract to bring the Asgardian survivors to Wakanda when Thanos' Black Order stopped them at the end of Thor: Ragnarok.

You can read a snippet of the multi-chapter story below:
<h5>THANOS</h5>
"Our princes," She sobbed, clutching hysterically at Bucky's shirt, "you must help them!"

"Prince?" He echoed, completely lost.

But by that time, Wakandan researchers were flocking into the destroyed lab, closely followed by their leader. T'Challa's eyes widened when they met his over the heads of the distressed people filling the halls. Bucky tried to convey his bewilderment with a shrug, his arms still full of the pregnant woman.

The portal fizzed, and with it, the last of the bizarrely-dressed people trickled out. It was a man and a woman, but she was barely holding him upright. Blood dripped down between the fingers pressed to the wound on his abdomen. His head lolled and T'Challa closed the distance between them with three quick strides, taking the brunt of the man's weight from the dark-haired woman. Something clattered to the ground and Bucky's eyes landed on the hilt of what was once a beautifully-crafted broadsword. The blade was no longer intact.

She fell to her knees, colorless lips parting to whisper-

"Thanos."
